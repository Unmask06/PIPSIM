# Installation Guide

## üöÄ What is Pipesim Pilot?

Pipesim Pilot is a desktop application designed to streamline the process of creating models, feeding data, running simulations, and generating reports in Pipesim. Built on top of the **Pipesim Python Toolkit**, it provides a user-friendly interface that enhances efficiency and reduces costs. Pipesim Pilot requires a license only when running simulations; for other functionalities like creating models, updating conditions, and summarizing results, only the Python Toolkit license is needed.

## ‚ùì Why is Pipesim Pilot Required?

Pipesim is a powerful but costly software, and with limited licenses available, managing multiple hydraulic projects can be challenging. Pipesim Pilot addresses this by offering a more intuitive and efficient way to interact with Pipesim, *reducing both time and cost*.
